I am doing modification for TD code, where adding target network to solve the TD Moving Target Problems.
"""
Temporal Difference (TD) Moving Target Problem
In Temporal Difference (TD) learning, the moving target problem refers to the instability caused by using the same model to both predict values and update targets. Specifically:

The TD target 
r
+
γ
V
(
s
′
)
r+γV(s 
′
 ) depends on the current estimate of 
V
(
s
′
)
V(s 
′
 ), which is produced by the model being trained.

As the model updates, 
V
(
s
′
)
V(s 
′
 ) changes, causing the target to "move" during training. This creates a feedback loop where the model chases a non-stationary target, leading to unstable training and poor convergence.
